        <h1>Banksy at Northeastern? Analyzing the Public Art of Campus</h1>

    		<div id="rightColumn"> <p>The art located on Northeastern’s campus features a young boy dressed in a dress shirt and tie carrying a stack of papers titled stencils as well as a spray paint can. Studying this piece, it is clear that the work shares an uncanny resemblance to some of the works created by famous street artist, Banksy. We see the same type of graffiti style work as well as a similar subject of a young child, often seen in Banksy’s work.</p><br><br>
            <p>However, there are some reasons to argue that it isn’t Bansky. First, Banksy’s pieces often feature figures in the midst of motion whether that be losing a balloon or hula hooping. With the young boy, he is found standing in place, absent of action. The main reason that I believe this isn’t Banksy is because the combination of location and subject does not match his purpose. Banksy is known for creating art that is motivated by political and social issues and the image of the boy located on a campus seems to do neither of those things.Perhaps if the painting featured Native American peoples of which Northeastern is located I would be more inclined to believe it is Banksy.</p>
